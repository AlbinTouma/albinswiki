### Recommendations 

-- Follow the money in war crimes investigations: Domestic and international
prosecutors should investigate financila evidence and networks in international
crimes cases. They should assume that financial evidence, motives, crimes, and
actors will be relevant until proven otherwise. 

-- Bring financial experts in from the beginning: International Criminal Court
(ICC) should fund investment in financial investigations and expertise. 

-- Collaborate across borders and use OSINT: improved cooperation between
countries and courts and more engagement with Anti-Corruption Coordination
Center in the UK. 

-- Pass and amend key legislation: UN member states should support the treaty
prohibiting Crimes Against Humanity to improve ease of legal action against
financial enablers of atrocities in domestic courts. Congress should amend the
United States war crimes statue to make pillage a predicate offense. 

-- Seize proceeds of crimes; Authorities should seize assets parked in their
jurisdictions. In the US, this effort is led by the US Department of Justice's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS). In the UK, authorities can do this under the Unexplained Wealth Orders and Magnitsky Amendment in the 2017 Criminal Finance Bill.

-- Pay affected communities back; US authorities should build networks with
affected communities to design asset return strategies. 

-- Support crucial agencies; US State Department should maintain support for GCJ
and develop stronger focus on targeting financial facilitators of atrocities.
FBI should maintain its International Human Rights Invesetigations Unit which
plays a role in cross-border evidence gatherting. 


### Nuremburg Trials

Despite the crucial role of foreign buers, commercial actors responsible for
facilitating serious international crimes are rarely held accountable in
court. This wasn't always true. 

During the 1948 Nuremburg trials, 13 executives from the German chemical company
IG Farben were convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity for their
role in producing Zyklon B. 

The observation of one lawyer in eastern Democractic Republic of Congo ring
true: "[The] lack of prosecution in the area of organised financial crime
encourages war crimes, and war itself". [^1]

It is possible to prosecute private actors. Take the case of Charles Taylor.
Prosecutors in the Netherlands successfully convicted a key source of financing
to Charles Taylor. Taylor was known for crimes against humanity in Sierra-leone.
His commercial partners operated in the shadows until Dutch authorities
investigated businessman Guus Kouwenhoven and convicted him in absentia for
providingweapons and support to then-President Taylor during the civil war in
Liberia. According to the judgment ,Kouwenhoven said he was part of Taylor's
second inner circle comprised of "major business people" with direct
relationships to Taylor who considered Kouwenhoven's company his "pepperbush"
during the war.

**Pepperbush** is a Liberian moniker meaning something of great
fianncial interest. Given the vast evidence showing that despsotic army,
government, and rebel leaders each have their own pepperbush networks, justice
authorities should work hard to ensure Kouwenhoven does not stand alone for
long. 

Recognising that international financial presusre can play an intervening role
in limiting violence and human rights abuses, policymakers in North America and
Europe have increased their attention to international financing and
kleptocracy. This trend suggests growing recognition that civil lawsuits, asset
seizures can helm bomat illicit finance, complementing sanctions and AML
measures, and together, helping curb the flow of money from war zones to
profiteers. 


## Case of Guus Kouwenhoven

The judgmen against Kouwenhoven described burning homes in villages and rape.
The timber merchant played a role in these acts, the court held, and some of
them were "deliberately solicited...by the defendant", according to the
decision. "Through the intermidiary of Charles Taylor", "Kouwenhoven's companies
recieved large areas for the exploiotation of the logging business in the form
of concessions." The court also found that the interests of Charles Taylour,
then president of Liberia, were deeply intertwined with defendant, the court
found. "Charles Taylor named the [defendant's company'] his pepperbush. 

In 2017, an appeals court sentences Kouwenhoven to 19 years in prison for aiding
and abetting war crimes and arms trafficking. The Dutch Supreme Court affirmed
the jusdmgnet in 2018, and Kouwenhoven is fighting extradition in South Africa. 

James G. Steward calls the world of arms trade, "a regulatory vacuum
characterised by the almost perfect absence of all forms of accountability", and
notes that "Kouwenhoven case is the first that holds a nefarious arms vendor
responsible for complicity in African atrocities." [^2]

Greed, theft, the transport of money and commodities, and financing networks are
directly relevant to atrocity crimes in East and Central Africa. Business
networks and military structures often overlap, and lines between finanical
profits and military victories often blur. 

In a note on the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), UN
special investigation unit foundL 

> The FDLR have structured a dense and diversified economic web, which in return
> shapes their military activities. Their military set-up is integrated into the
> map of resources. [Armed groups headquarters] are embedded in areas of
> business interest  [^3] 

## Arresting indicted war criminals is one of the Achilles' heels of international justice

The non-enforcement of arrest warrants by governments is one of the achillees'
heels of international justice. 

Omar al-Bashir whose arrest warrant for crimes against humanity and war crimes was issued in 2008, travelled numerious times to those countries whose governments are signatories of the Rome Statute and thus have a legal duty to arrest him. 

A promising example is Michael Desaedeleer. He was an American-Belgian citizen
accused of conspiring with Taylor and Sierra Leonean narmed group leaader Foday
Sankoh to traffic weapons into Sierra Leone and enslave civilians in
diamond-rich territories. The arrangements led to a profitable diamonds export
business for Desaedeleer.
