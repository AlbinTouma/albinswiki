title: Comments in Rust
layout: default
---

A simple comment begins with two back slashes `//`.
For comments that extend beyond a single line you need // at each line

``// Hello
// My name is 
//Albin
``

Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code or above them:
``
fn main(){
    let x  = 7; //I'm feling lucky today
    // An apple a day keeps the doctor away
    let y = 1
}
