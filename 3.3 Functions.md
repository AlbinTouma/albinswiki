title: Rust Functions
layout: default
---

Rust uses snake case as conventional style for variables and functions
(lowercase and sep by underscore). 

Rust doesn't care where you define your functions, only that they're defined
somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller. This means the functions can be inside main or after or before main.

The lines execute in the order in which they appear in `main` function.

## Parameters

`parameters` are special variables that are part of a functions signature. You
can give parameters concrete values, technically these concrete values are
called `arguments`. 

``
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}``

In the code above, we have one parameter named x, specified as i32. In function
signatures, `you must declare the type of each paramter`. Type annotation means
that the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to
figure out what type you mean. 

When declaring multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with
commas like this: 

``
fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
}``


Print labelled measurement takes two arguments - value is i32 and unit_lable is
char. 

## Statements and Expressions

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an
expression. The functions above haven't included ending expressions. 

- `Statementes` are instructions that perform some action and do not return a
  value. Function definitions are also statements. Statements do not return a
  value. Statements **end** in `;` and do not return a value. 
- `Expressions` evaluate to a resultant value. Calling a function is an
  expression, calling a macro is an expression; a new scope block created with
  curly brackets is an expression. They do **not** end in `;`. and return a
  value. 
  
  fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
 ``
 
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}

This expression

{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
``
is a block that evaluates to 4. That value gets bound to y. Note that x+1 does
not have a semicolon. Expressions do not include ending semicolons because if
you do you turn it into a statement, meaning it will not return a value. 

#Functions with Return Values

Functions can return a value to the code that calls them. We don't name return
values, but we must declare their type after an arrow `-->`. In Rust, the return
value of the function is the same as the value of the final expression in the
block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using
`return` keyword at a specific value, but most functions return the last value
implicitly. 

``
fn five() -> i32{
    5
}

fn main() }
    let x = five(); 
} 
``
There are no function calls, macros, or even let statements in the five
function. This is the same as saying let x  = 5. The five function is also
missin parameters.
