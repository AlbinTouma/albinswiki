title: Reserach Proposal
---

Goals:

The research proposal should answer the following questions
1. Highlight of the research is original or significant
2. Explain how it will develop current knoweldge
3. Identify the importance of your research
4. Show why you are the right person to do this research

Name: Albin Denis Touma
Proposed Title: xxxxxxx


## One paragraph synopsis
<i>A straightforward, descriptive, and informatie outline of the scope of the research and what it aims to achieve</i>


## Relevance of topic to course themes
<i>An account of why this topic is relevant and worth investigating</i>


Significantly reducing IFFs by 2030 is one of the prioritiesunder the UN's SDG 16. UNCTAD ad UNODC are custodians fo SDG indicator 16.4.1, which measures the total value  of inward and outward IFFss in current US efforts to encourage standardisation of domestic legislation through the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, there remains the issue of jurisdictional differences, both in laws and behaviours. What is legal in one country is not so elsewhere and comparably, the behaviour of otherwise legal actors may breach laws in one state and not another. 



## Main reserach question
<i>A proposed main reserach question (or hypothesis) which should be focused and not overly broad</i>




## Reserach context
<i>To what extent has the question already been answered and what area(s) would benefit from new knoweldge?  You should aim to refer to papers/articles that you can access and add these to reference list</i>

- How illicit financial flows undermine security and stability in
regions? 

Owen Prelec and Mayne (2022) mapped how different aspects of Russian foreign policy
interact with different forms of IFF. Their conceptualisation goes a long way
in answering how IFF funds three foreign policy activities: political intereference, war, and ideology.  David Lewis, Tena Prelec, and Catherine Owen build on previous research by the
team in the SOC ACE. They show, through a series of case studies, how the Russian State uses IFF to facilitate foreign policy activities and destabilise fragile states. 



#Brief](states.#Brief) overview of proposed reserach design and methods
<i>How do I plan to undertake the reserach</i>

Conclusions will be drawn from systematic analysis of four different sources of
data: [i] GI-TOC research reports; [ii] a comprehensive literature review; [iv]
data and network analysis of entities on sanctions lists. 




## Likely data and means to access the sources



## Reference list/Bibliography

## Objectives
 
- To identify patterns of behaviour

<u>Reserach Questions</u> 
- How do sanctioned entities respond to sanctions?
- What are the common features of individuals and companies on sanctioned lists or connected to a sanctioned entity? 

## Brief justification of proposed reserach project

The aim ois to identify x relating to sanctions evasion with reserach of current AML regulations and in particular y

The existing UN development goals SDG z aims to prevent the "illicit flow of money".
