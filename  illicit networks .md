title: New Dynamics in Illicit Finance and Russian Foreign Policy
---
> This paper develops an updated conceptualisation of the linkages between IFF and Russian foreigin policy in the context of rapid changes in the international 
environment and inside the Russian regime following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It reviews recent reserach on the use of IFF in Russian international operations and show that IFF
has become even more deeply emeshed in the Russian state and FP. 

It covers following reserach gaps
- The role of the state in facilitating IFF is under researched and often overlooked compared to the study of how IFF harms global development
- The role of iFF in facilitating foreign policy activities that are destabilising and undermine democracy and governance
- Not focused on IFF aimed at safeguarding asset, tax avoidance, funding the lifestyles of the rich outside. Focus on role of illicit finance in Russia's security and foreign policy. 
- Many aspects of Russia's domestic political economy have been extensively reserached, detailed work on dynamics and causal links between Russian business, illicit finance, and Russian foreign policy
remain limited but there's widespread consensus that private interests play a role in Russian foreign policy. However, focus on the super-rich obscures the real workings of illicit finance in the Russian state. 

They build on previous research by the team in the SOC ACE research programme, which demonstrated the ways in which Russia illicit financial flows (IFF) and 
Russian serious and organised crime (SOC) act as important instruments of Russian foreign and security policy, and pose a threat to Western democracies. 
The research also demonstrates the potentially destabilising impact of Russian IFF in conflict-affected and fragile states, including in Africa (Owen, 2022) in
liminal countries hoping to join the EU (ie Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine). Russia's full-scale invasion in Ukraine has made illicit finance more important in Russian foreign policy.

Despite sanctions, many Russian officials and business people, particularly those in security services or the military, are thriving in wartime. 

## Definitions and scope

In 2015, the OECD proposed a concise definition of IFF: 

> "all cross-border financial transfers, which contravene national or international laws" (OECD 2016). A study on Russian illicit flows defines them as "funds that are
> illegally earned, transferred, or utilized" (Kar & Freitas, 2013, p.6). In 2017, the World Bank advanced a wider definition of IFF as "money ilegally earned, transferred, or used
> that crosses borders" (World Bank, 2017). The World Bank report argues that IFF entails acts that are themselves illegal (ie tax evasion) or the funds are result 
of illegal acts (smuggling, trafficking in drugs etc) or the funds are used for illegal purposes. 

Some argue for an even wider definition to emphasise that illicit also refers to funds attained corruply and immorally but not necessarily illegally. 
Chowla and Falcao (2016) argue that illicit should be something wider and instead point to OECD's deintion of illicit as improper, irregular, esp not sanctioned by law, rule or custom, 
and that financial flows should encompass both transnational and domestic. 


Despite differences in definition, the significance of IFF is acknoweldged. Target 16.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims by 2030 to significantly reduce illicit financial arms flows,
strengthen the recovery and return of assets and combat all forms of organised crime. The negative impact of IFF on global development is acknowledged, but this paper highglights
the role of IFF in facilitating foreign policy activities that are destabilising an dundermine democracy and governance. 

Many of the mechanisms that facilitate IFF are well understood. Lumina argues that iFF are facilitated by offshore, tax havens, secrecy jurisdictions, shell companies, shadowy trust accounts, sham charitable foundations (Lumina 2018, p.320)
Despite sancitons, many Russian actors use off-the-books financial mechanisms, including cash transfers, gold, diamond smuggling, crypto-currency transactions. The role of the state
in certain countries in facilitating IFF is under researched and often overlooked. 


## Why important

Russia's operation in the financial grey zone requires better understanding and more scrutiny. Research in the area is complex and time-consuming bu offers important insights
into new trends in Russian foreign policy behaviour and decision making. 

## The political economy of foreign policy

> "Corrosive capital" to influence neighbouring states
> Sanctions circumvention to keep economy going
> Private military companies to project power
> Geoeconomics as war by other means

One viwe is that the Russian state is the key actor using illicit or corrupt business dealings as forms of 'strategic corruption' or competition in the 'Financial Gray Zone' to
achieve geopolitical goals (Conley, 2022). In, 2022, US Assistant Secretary for FTerrorist Financing and Finacial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg calimed that illicit finance
is a major national secutiyy threat, citing Russia's war in Ukraine as an example. 

A differnt view is that Russia is a kleptocracy in which foreign and domestic policy decisions are determined primarily by personal financial intersts (Dawisha, 2015, Marten 2015). 
The state is less important than multiple personal vested interests who use Russian foreign policy to enrich themselves. 


In reality, IFF is not simply an instrument of the Russian state or a way for businesspeople to shape foreign policy in their own interests. The relationship is more complex. 
Ideology shapes world views, defines threats, helps interepret the world (Lewis 2022). Economics and military capabilities limit ideological aspirations and geopolitics places constraints. 
But illicit finance augments these essential drivers in three ways.

1. IFF ensures Russian geopolitical strategies are successfully implemented because elites have vested interest in positive outocmes. We see this in big infrastructure projects with economic and geopolitical
impact ie RUssian gas pipeline to China, 'The power of Siberaia', which came online in 2019. The US 55 billion price tag for the pipeline was artificiall boosted by excess profits for 
well-connected Gazprom contractors (RIley, 2021, Sberbank, 2018). This reduced the commercial value of the pipeline but also ensured its completion because there were
vested interests in subcontracting the pipeline construction. Similar logic follows Turkstream project which lets Russian export gas to Turkey and Europe without Ukrainian transit. 
2. Illicit finance is used to compensate for Russian economic and diplomatic weakness. The use of non-formal state actors such as private military companies (PMCs) like Wagner 
   lets Russia project power despite its weakness. They offer flexible funding, including opaque funding from other sources including commerical inocme. Russia maintains influence
   through "corrosive capital in neighbouring states such as Georgia, Uzbekistan, Khazakstan (Prelex, 2020, RFE/RL, 2023). 
3. Illicit finance plays a critical role in maintianing Russian economy and military after sanctions. This includes substantial trade and financial flows through key hubs: Turkey, UAE, Kazakhstan (O'Shea et al 2023). Dubious financial deals, banking arrangemnts helped Russian oil sales keep stable. US sanctioned hundreds of individuals and companies involved in cirucmvention of sanctions in Switzerland, India, UAR and elsewehere (US Treasury 2023, May 19)


## Geoeconomics vs Geopolitics

Scholars noted significant differences between geopolitics and geoeconomics. Wigell and
Vihma (2016, p. 605) highlighted the difference between the use of military and
economic power as follows:

> Geopolitical power projection, as an offensive foreign policy operation, is
> typically overt, conducted by military means, and its operational logic is
> confrontation. Geoeconomic power projection, on the other hand, is more
> covert, conducted by economic means, and its operational logic is selective
> accommodation. These differences elicit in turn diverging tendencies in the
> target country or coalition. Traditional geopolitics typically producescentripetal forces, high threat perception, and counterbalancing or
> bandwagoning behaviour. Geoeconomics, by contrast, creates centrifugal forces, low or medium threat perception, and underbalancing behaviour.
