David Lewis and Tena Prelec answer the following reserach gaps: 

1. The role of the state in facilitating IFF is under researched and often overlooked compared to the study of how IFF harms global development
2. The role of IFF in facilitating foreign policy activities that are destabilising and undermine democracy and governance
3. Many aspects of Russia's domestic political economy have been extensively reserached, detailed work on dynamics and causal links between Russian business, illicit finance, and Russian foreign policy remain limited but there's widespread consensus that private interests play a role in Russian foreign policy. However, focus on the super-rich obscures the real workings of illicit finance in the Russian state. 
   
Lewis and Prelec build on previous research by the team in the SOC ACE research programme, which demonstrated the ways in which Russia illicit financial flows (IFF) and 
Russian serious and organised crime (SOC) act as important instruments of Russian foreign and security policy, and pose a threat to Western democracies. 
The research also demonstrates the potentially destabilising impact of Russian IFF in conflict-affected and fragile states, including in Africa (Owen, 2022) in
liminal countries hoping to join the EU (ie Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine). Russia's full-scale invasion in Ukraine has made illicit finance more important in Russian foreign policy.

## Definitions and scope

In 2015, the OECD proposed a concise definition of IFF: 

> "all cross-border financial transfers, which contravene national or international laws" (OECD 2016). A study on Russian illicit flows defines them as "funds that are
> illegally earned, transferred, or utilized" (Kar & Freitas, 2013, p.6). In 2017, the World Bank advanced a wider definition of IFF as "money ilegally earned, transferred, or used
> that crosses borders" (World Bank, 2017). The World Bank report argues that IFF entails acts that are themselves illegal (ie tax evasion) or the funds are result 
of illegal acts (smuggling, trafficking in drugs etc) or the funds are used for illegal purposes. 

Some argue for an even wider definition to emphasise that illicit also refers to funds attained corruply and immorally but not necessarily illegally. 
Chowla and Falcao (2016) argue that illicit should be something wider and instead point to OECD's deintion of illicit as improper, irregular, esp not sanctioned by law, rule or custom, 
and that financial flows should encompass both transnational and domestic. 

Despite differences in definition, the significance of IFF is acknoweldged. Target 16.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims by 2030 to significantly reduce illicit financial arms flows,
strengthen the recovery and return of assets and combat all forms of organised crime. The negative impact of IFF on global development is acknowledged, but this paper highglights
the role of IFF in facilitating foreign policy activities that are destabilising an dundermine democracy and governance. 

Many of the mechanisms that facilitate IFF are well understood. Lumina argues that iFF are facilitated by offshore, tax havens, secrecy jurisdictions, shell companies, shadowy trust accounts, sham charitable foundations (Lumina 2018, p.320).Despite sancitons, many Russian actors use off-the-books financial mechanisms, including cash transfers, gold, diamond smuggling, crypto-currency transactions. The role of the state in certain countries in facilitating IFF is under researched and often overlooked. 


## Why research on IFF is important

Russia's operation in the financial grey zone requires better understanding and more scrutiny. Research in the area is complex and time-consuming bu offers important insights
into new trends in Russian foreign policy behaviour and decision making. 

## The political economy of foreign policy

> <span style='background-color:yellow;">Corrosive capital"</span> to influence neighbouring states
> Sanctions circumvention to keep economy going
> Private military companies to project power
> Geoeconomics as war by other means

One view is that the Russian state is the key actor using illicit or corrupt business dealings as forms of 'strategic corruption' or competition in the 'Financial Gray Zone' to
achieve geopolitical goals (Conley, 2022). In, 2022, US Assistant Secretary for FTerrorist Financing and Finacial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg calimed that illicit finance
is a major national secutiyy threat, citing Russia's war in Ukraine as an example. 

A different view is that Russia is a kleptocracy in which foreign and domestic policy decisions are determined primarily by personal financial intersts (Dawisha, 2015, Marten 2015). 
The state is less important than multiple personal vested interests who use Russian foreign policy to enrich themselves. 

In reality, IFF is not simply an instrument of the Russian state or a way for businesspeople to shape foreign policy in their own interests. The relationship is more complex. 
Ideology shapes world views, defines threats, helps interepret the world (Lewis 2022). Economics and military capabilities limit ideological aspirations and geopolitics places constraints. 
But illicit finance augments these essential drivers in three ways.

1. IFF ensures Russian geopolitical strategies are successfully implemented because elites have vested interest in positive outocmes. We see this in big infrastructure projects with economic and geopolitical impact ie RUssian gas pipeline to China, 'The power of Siberaia', which came online in 2019. The US 55 billion price tag for the pipeline was artificiall boosted by excess profits for 
well-connected Gazprom contractors (RIley, 2021, Sberbank, 2018). This reduced the commercial value of the pipeline but also ensured its completion because there were vested interests in subcontracting the pipeline construction. Similar logic follows Turkstream project which lets Russian export gas to Turkey and Europe without Ukrainian transit. 
2. Illicit finance is used to compensate for Russian economic and diplomatic weakness. The use of non-formal state actors such as private military companies (PMCs) like Wagner 
   lets Russia project power despite its weakness. They offer flexible funding, including opaque funding from other sources including commerical inocme. Russia maintains influence
   through "corrosive capital in neighbouring states such as Georgia, Uzbekistan, Khazakstan (Prelex, 2020, RFE/RL, 2023). 
3. Illicit finance plays a critical role in maintianing Russian economy and military after sanctions. This includes substantial trade and financial flows through key hubs: Turkey, UAE, Kazakhstan (O'Shea et al 2023). Dubious financial deals, banking arrangemnts helped Russian oil sales keep stable. US sanctioned hundreds of individuals and companies involved in cirucmvention of sanctions in Switzerland, India, UAR and elsewehere (US Treasury 2023, May 19)


## Geoeconomics vs Geopolitics

Scholars noted significant differences between geopolitics and geoeconomics. Wigell and
Vihma (2016, p. 605) highlighted the difference between the use of military and
economic power as follows:

> Geopolitical power projection, as an offensive foreign policy operation, is
> typically overt, conducted by military means, and its operational logic is
> confrontation. Geoeconomic power projection, on the other hand, is more
> covert, conducted by economic means, and its operational logic is selective
> accommodation. These differences elicit in turn diverging tendencies in the
> target country or coalition. Traditional geopolitics typically producescentripetal forces, high threat perception, and counterbalancing or
> bandwagoning behaviour. Geoeconomics, by contrast, creates centrifugal forces, low or medium threat perception, and underbalancing behaviour.


This reading is misleading because for Russia, geoeconomics was not an alternative to military action but its accompaniment. 

## Key vectos of Russian foreign polic conceptualising IFF

Illicit Finance is used to pursue 3 foreign policy areas. Previous reserach (Owen, Prelec, Mayne 2022, p9) developed a  conceptual framework that maps different forms of IFF interacting with 
different aspects of Russian foreign policy in a venn diagram: 

- War and Violence (assassinations, military interventions, illegal occuupation, paramilitary forces, defence supply chains, orchestrating coups)
- Ideology and narratives (pro-Russian media outlets, ideologicla networks, recruting influencers, fake news, troll factories, humanitarian foundations, orchestrating protests),
- Political Interference ( Funding political leaders, fixing elections, energy and trade pressure, financing pro-Russian ngos, parties, orchestrating coups, orchestrating protests)


# Political Inteference and Information Campaigns 

<b>Corrosive capital </b> : Political influence achieved through investments accompanied by particularistic and rent seeking ties between political and business actors that have
impacts on governance. There's close tie between Russian busines circles close to the Kremlin and the gas industry in Uzbekistan (RFE/RL, 2023). Such insider deals have taken on a 
geopolitical meaning after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Then, there's Russia's near monopoly on gas in Serbia that complicates their pathway to the EU (Bechev, 2023), while rent-seeking
structures such as gas intermediary schemes are sued to reward loyal individuals. 

<b>Political Funding</b>: A second mode of indluence is direct fundin of political parties, leaders, infleuncers. Previous SOC ACE reserach traced links between Russian IFF and political parties in Europe (Mayne, 2022). 
There is extensive evidence of Russian fundin and support directed to politicians in Europe sympathetics to Moscow (Datta, 2022). War placed strain on Russian ties to right-wing parties.
Le Pen ='s Rassemblement is unlikely to agree to a multi-million loan from Russian-linked bank as they did in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea (Sonne, 2018). A report in The Washington Post, based on 
leaked documents, detailed a strategy drawn up in Moscow to promote anti-war activities in Germany and support alignemnt between AfD and leftist Die Linke party to undermine
support for Ukraine.  The Washinton Post also points out that Moscow has long cultivated dozens of AfD members through lavish all expenses paid trips to Russia (Belton et al, 2023). 

<b>Electoral Interference</b>: Private financing to interfere in elections give Russia deniability. The Mueller report concluded that Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Concord companies funded the
Internat Reserach Agency, troll farm, that ran an information campaign against Hilary Clinton in 2016 (Mueller, 2019, p 16). In 2018 Bolivian election, a report by investigative group Proekt, found that Russian 
political technologists linked to Rosatom ran a social media campaign to back the re-electiono of pro-Mosoc president Evo Morales.

<b>Disruption and subversion</b>: Aims to fund marginal disruptive elements rather than influence mainstream politics. Pay protestrers to cause disruption rather than influence governments.
Direct funding in cash to incentivise poeople to join protests has been reported in Africa. A documentary film showed what it claimed were internal spreadsheets detailing payments to 
demonstrators in CAR. According to the documents, the five protests cost 4, 636 USD to protest against the UN Mission in the country (Jousset, 2013, 16:39). There's no way to 
verify the documents independently but they accord with practice in funding demonstartions in Russia and other post-soviet states.

## Case Study Moldova

Russia's strategy includes many of these diverse tactics. Russia uses state companies to cultivate network of Moldovan politicians and reorient the country toward Moscow (Belton 2022). Tactics include distributing cash, crypto, channeling money through foundations and business associations. 


# Defence Procurement Networks

Illicit finance has always played a role in procuring military technology. An anonymous security source told journalists that Russia flew 140 million USD in cash to Iran to purchse Iranian
military drones (Haynes, 2023). Similar cash and barter deals appear to have been used in arms deals with North Korea. In 2023, US sanctioned an individual fro brokering financial and
barter deals, including supplying commercial aircraft, raw materials, and commodities to fund arms exports to Russia from North Korea (US Treasury, 2023, March 30). 

In 2023, February, US Treasury sanctioned 22 members of the Zimenkov network, a group of companies associated with the arms dealder Igor Zimenkov. The Zimenkov network had used 
font companies to funnel money within the networkh while attempting to appear lawful. In October 2022, Italian authorities arrested Artem Uss, the son of Governor of Krasnoyarsk, Alexander Uss. 
Another business man ,Yuri Orekhov, was arrested in Germany in October (Bloomber, 2023). They used, according to US Justice Department, 'Webs of companies, cryptocurrency, and international network of fraudsters to launder money and obtain US military technology'
(US Department of Justice, 2022, October 19.). 

## Business-military ties in [Syria](Syria)

> Reliance on cash
> Use of mercenaries to seize mines, oil fields, other assts in exchange for a share in the business

Illicit finance accompanied Russian military campaigns overseas. Companies linkeed to Gennady Timchenko, close associate of Putin, and owner of Stroytransgaz, won contracts in Syria. 
One such company was Stroytransgaz Engineering (STG Engineering). He acquired it in 2016 to invest in oil exploration, tourism, phosphate production, bu then sold the company two years later to
two shell companies. According to investigators, European companies are among the buyers relying on convoluted network of shell companies and middlement to fund their purchases (Bassiki, Alfred, Deeb and Oganov, 2022)

The other major Russian economic presence in Syria has been a convoluted network of
companies believed to be linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin's Concord group and centred on
the Evro Polis company. It is alleged that Evro Polis and STG Engineering were both
favoured suppliers in a Russian loan scheme that probably involved inflated prices
charged for Russian exports (Weiss, 2022, April 5). Evro Polis appears to have been
active in different business sectors; it was estimated to have generated net profits of
US$90 million in 2020 (Johnson, 2023). Other companies in Syria have also been linked
to Prigozhin’s corporate networks (AEOW 2022, 26 September).

According to an in-depth report by the Global Initiative on Transnational Organized
Crime (GI-TOC), Prigozhin relied on a kaleidoscope of shell companies to run his
domestic and international business (Stanyard 2023). But on the ground, much of the
business was run in cash. According to one former Wagner commander, Wagner’s office
in Damascus keeps large amounts of cash to pay salaries and allay expenses. According
to the source, a battalion commander once withdrew US$200,000 in cash for expenses.
One report claimed that the cash was brought in and out of Syria by private jet
(Patrikarakos, 2023). In Russia itself, Wagner also appears to have relied primarily on
cash in its operations. After the Wagner mutiny, Russian police reportedly seized more
than US$100 million in cash and gold bars from vehicles and offices belonging to
Prigozhin, which the businessman claimed were for Wagner salaries. The money was
later returned to Prigozhin (Moscow Times 2023, July 4).

Syria became the laboratory for a new model of Russian investment that was later reproduced in the Central African Republic (CAR) and elsewhere, using mercenary
forces to seize mines, oil fields and other assets in exchange for a share in the business (Korotkov, 2017, June 26 ). Reports of such a deal first emerged in 2017, when sources
in the Syrian Ministry of Energy, quoted by independent Russian news site Fontanka.ru, claimed that a memorandum was signed by the Syrian Government’s General Petroleum
Corporation with Evro Polis, according to which Evro Polis undertook to ‘liberate oil and gas fields, refineries, other oil and gas infrastructure facilities seized by opponents of the
regime, and then protect them’. The effort would be rewarded with a 25% share of future oil and gas production plus the cost of military operations (Korotkov, 2017, June
26). Such an agreement might explain the strange operation launched by Wagner in early 2018, when some hundreds of Wagner fighters and Syrian forces attacked an
outpost manned by U.S. Special Forces at the Conoco gas plant, in Deir Ezzor province. Despite warnings to pull back, the attack went on and was met by massive air strikes,
causing heavy losses. It remains unclear whether the Russian government, or part thereof, had approved the operation (Reynolds, 2019).
