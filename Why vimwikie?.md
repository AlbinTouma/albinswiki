## My Ulysess Pact

In the Odyssey, Ulysses wanted to hear the Sirenes songs and ordered his men to tie him to the mast. This way, he guarded himself from making bad decisions by setting up a framework to control his future self.
This is a Ulyseess Pact. Leaving your car keys at home before going to the pub is a Ulysess Pact just as standardising tools on plain texts is a Ulysess Pact.

The idea is to safeguard against trying the latest hot project management, note taking, or scrum system. 
So why bother tying ourselves to the plain text/neovim mast and not another note taking software? 

## Why Neovim and not another note taking software? 

Note taking softwares complicate note taking. They are rich in features and trap us in apps that force us to focus on the app rather than work.
Ineffective note taking and vendor-lock are all problems with Notion, Obsidian, and Drive. They can all be difficiult to read let alone organise and navigate.

I've decided on building a wiki in markdown for these reasons:
- Markdown keeps us focused on what's most important; getting work done.
- Most software is standardised on markdown to format text. It's simple to use, meaning we can use any program to read them.
- Markdown files can be uploaded to github and hosted as html files.
