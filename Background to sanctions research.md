There are five major sources of illicit financal flows (IFFs) - bribery, tax evasion, criminal enterprise earnings, corporate profit shifting, and currency regulation evasion, and the mvoement of monies ie cash smuggling, shell corporations, 
trade based money laundering. These sources belong to both legal and illegal activities. Legal activities are illicit tax and commercial practices; aggressive tax avoidance. Illegal activities are
illegal tax and commerical practices, illegal markets, corruption, exploitation-type and terrorism financing. Significantly reducing IFFs by 2030 is one of the priorities under the UN's SDG 16. UNCTAD and UNODC are custodians fo SDG indicator 16.4.1, which measures the total value  of inward and outward IFFs
in current US dollars. 

Despite efforts to encourage standardisation of domestic legislation through the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, there remains the issue of jurisdictional differences, both in laws
and behaviours. What is legal in one country is not so elsewhere and comparably, the behaviour of otherwise legal actors may breach laws in one state and not another. 

Some interesting topics related to the theme of evaluating AML's contribution to peace and justice and SDG 16.4.

1. Who gets sanctioned? Finance and statecraft - are international sanctions and AML regimes being weapoinzed? 
2. How do illicit financial flows undermine security and stability in regions?

-[ Russia's illicit networks ](russias_illicit_networks.md)growing use of illicit networks risks damaging the integrity of international financial and trading systems to support its defence procurement networks, business military ties in Syria, and IFF and Wagner in Africa. 
        
    
4. Terrornomics; the sanctions and international money laundering legal order as a security governance tool to combat illicit finance in transnational security spaces. 
5. Sustainable competitiveness, hawk/dove game theory, sanctions, blocking statues, and anti-sanctions laws. 
6. Hawks/doves in lawfare ; how stronger states taget weaker countries.
7. 5. The choice of how we define illicit
8. Beneficial ownership registries; what is the evidence that they prevent crime ie are they effective contributions to peace and justice?

The world needs comparable and reliable statistics on IFFs to shed light on sectors and activities most prone to illicit finance. 
UNCTAD and UNODC published a conceptual framework for the Statistical Measurement of Illicit Financial Flows endoresed by the United Nations Statistical Commission in March 2022.
