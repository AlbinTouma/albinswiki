[#] How we organise langauge learning

Tools: 
- Ankivim - lets you integrate with Anki and create as well as review cards without leaving your editor. 

- Vim-flashcards - specifically designed to add and review flashcards within neovim

- [Inka]( https://github.com/salkirr/inka) is a python script. It converts md to flashcards. Supports question/answers.

- [Apy](https://github.com/lervag/apy) is another Python script. Similar to Inka.

- [Learning with Texts](https://learning-with-texts.sourceforge.io/) is an open
  source tool inspired by Steve Kaufmann's LinQ system. You define langauges
  you want to learn and imoprt texts you wnat to use for learning. While
  listening to the audio (optional) you read the text, save, review, and test
  words or multiword expressions (2-9 words). Import and export words in
  TSV/CSV format.
